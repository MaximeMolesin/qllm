# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of individual liberty and voluntary association, we pledge to foster an environment of free expression, personal responsibility, and mutual respect within our project community.

## Our Principles

We believe in **capitalism** and **free markets** as the foundation for innovation and progress. This belief extends to the marketplace of ideas within our project community.

## Our Standards

We believe in the power of free markets of ideas and behaviors. As such, we encourage:

1. Open and honest communication
2. Voluntary collaboration
3. Personal accountability
4. Respect for individual rights and property
5. Merit-based recognition and advancement

We discourage:

1. Initiation of force or fraud against others
2. Violation of intellectual property rights
3. Deliberate interference with others' ability to participate in the project
4. Attempts to stifle competition or innovation

## Enforcement

We believe in self-governance and dispute resolution through voluntary means. If conflicts arise:

1. Individuals are encouraged to resolve disputes directly with each other.
2. If direct resolution is not possible, community members may voluntarily seek mediation from project maintainers.
3. In extreme cases where behavior significantly disrupts the project, maintainers reserve the right to remove contributions or restrict access to project resources.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to GitHub repositories, communication channels, and project events. It also applies to external spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html, and modified to align with libertarian and capitalist principles.

## Conclusion

We believe that a free and open community, based on voluntary interactions, mutual respect, and free market principles, will naturally foster innovation and productivity. By participating in this project, you agree to uphold these principles and respect the rights of others.
